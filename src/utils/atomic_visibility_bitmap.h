/**
 * @brief A grow-only, per-slot visibility flag map backed by atomic words.
 *
 * Each slot owns one bit. The intended use is a "publish after fully written"
 * pattern: a producer writes a slot's payload and then calls Mark(slot)
 * (release), while a consumer calls IsReady(slot) (acquire) before reading the
 * payload. The release/acquire pair establishes a happens-before edge so the
 * consumer that observes a set bit is guaranteed to see the fully written
 * payload.
 *
 * Bits are only ever set, never cleared (other than via Resize/the ctor), so
 * the consumer side is free of TOCTOU races: observing "ready" once means
 * ready forever.
 *
 * Concurrency contract:
 *   - Mark() and IsReady() are safe to call concurrently with each other.
 *   - Resize() reallocates the backing storage and is NOT safe to run
 *     concurrently with Mark()/IsReady(); the caller must serialise Resize()
     *     against all Mark()/IsReady() via an external lock. In HGraph,
     *     resize() takes global_mutex_ exclusively; add-side call sites
     *     coordinate resize and slot publication with their own synchronization.
