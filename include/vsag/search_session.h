/**
 * @brief Continue-search session produced by creating a SearchSession from an index.
 *
 * Owns the immutable query specification, search state, and lifecycle of a
 * continuing similarity search.  After OpenSearchSession the caller advances
 * the search with Next to receive non-overlapping candidate batches until
 * exhausted or closed. HGraph initializes query computers and routes lazily
 * on the first Next, and retains its frontier, cached scores and delivery state.
 * Each Next expands at least max(ef_search, max_candidates) remaining
 * frontier vertices (or exhausts it), continuing further to fill a filtered page.
 * Results are sorted within a page, not guaranteed globally sorted across pages.
 * Does not extend IteratorContext; existing iterator
 * APIs remain unchanged. The query is deep-copied and the backend is retained.
 * Sessions are single-consumer: do not call Next/HasMore/Close concurrently,
 * or mutate the index. Filters may change between calls (even the same object),
 * but must remain stable during Next. Every call rechecks discovered undelivered
 * IDs, including earlier rejects. Delivered IDs never return again.
 * Empty filtered batches are not terminal: stop on empty for the current request,
 * rather than looping solely on HasMore under an unsatisfiable filter.
 * Exhaustion means the retained approximate search scope is exhausted, not
 * that every vector in the index has been enumerated. HGraph enumerates the
 * reachable bottom graph. HasMore may be true before filtering finds any result.
 * The optional caller allocator must outlive the session; returned result buffers
 * are independently owned and may outlive both session and index.
 * External allocator/thread-pool resources borrowed by the index must also outlive the session.
 * Specialized RaBitQ, parallel/timed/factored/brute-force/hop-limited searches,
 * explicit filter skipping, shared duplicate storage, force removal, active MCI and
 * conjugate search are rejected. Ordinary filtering, threshold and reorder are
 * supported, including ordinary duplicate labels; filtered vertices remain traversable bridges.
 * On a nonterminal session, demand outside [1, INT64_MAX] returns INVALID_ARGUMENT without
 * changing state. Results allocate only the actual returned count, not the requested upper bound.
 * Actual result-size overflow or allocation failure is an execution error and closes the session.
 * Non-finite upper-route recovery is capped at 65536 visited vertices per level; exceeding
 * this safety limit is an execution error.
 * Errors during traversal close the session; already returned results stay valid.
 * Terminal/closed Next calls return empty with cumulative work statistics preserved
 * and zero per-round work, without demand validation. Close releases traversal storage.
